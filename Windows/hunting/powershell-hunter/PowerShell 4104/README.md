## Why PowerShell-Hunter?

PowerShell is both a powerful administrative tool and a favorite weapon for attackers. While its extensive logging capabilities are great for security, the sheer volume of logs can be overwhelming. PowerShell-Hunter helps defenders cut through the noise and focus on what matters.

### Key Benefits

- 🔍 **Smart Pattern Detection**: Pre-configured patterns catch common attack techniques
- 📊 **Risk Scoring**: Prioritize investigation with weighted scoring system
- 🚀 **Performance Optimized**: Efficiently process thousands of events
- 📝 **Flexible Output**: Export to CSV or JSON for further analysis
- 🛠 **Extensible**: Easy to add custom detection patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator access (for reading Event Logs)
- Windows PowerShell Operational Logs enabled

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MHaggis/PowerShell-Hunter.git
```

2. Navigate to the PowerShell-Hunter directory:
```powershell
cd PowerShell-Hunter
```

3. Run the analyzer:
```powershell
.\Analyze-PowerShellEvents.ps1 -PatternFile "Patterns.csv"
```

### Basic Usage for PowerShell 4104 Hunting

```powershell
# Analyze last 5000 events and export to CSV
.\Analyze-PowerShellEvents.ps1 -PatternFile "Patterns.csv"

# Export to JSON instead
.\Analyze-PowerShellEvents.ps1 -PatternFile "Patterns.csv" -OutputFormat JSON

# Analyze specific number of events
.\Analyze-PowerShellEvents.ps1 -PatternFile "Patterns.csv" -MaxEvents 1000
```

## How It Works

PowerShell-Hunter analyzes Event ID 4104 (PowerShell script block logging) events using pattern matching and risk scoring:

1. **Event Collection**: Retrieves PowerShell script block logging events
2. **Pattern Matching**: Checks events against known suspicious patterns
3. **Risk Scoring**: Assigns weighted scores based on matched patterns
4. **Result Export**: Outputs findings in CSV or JSON format

### Sample Output

```
PS C:\Users\Administrator\test> .\Analyze-PowerShellEvents.ps1 -PatternFile "Patterns.csv" -OutputFormat csv -OutputFile .\mike.json

```
## Pattern Customization

The `Patterns.csv` file contains detection patterns and their risk scores. Each pattern includes:

- Category: Pattern classification
- Pattern: Regular expression for detection
- Score: Risk score (1-5)

Example pattern:
```csv
Category,Pattern,Score
EncodedCommand,"[A-Za-z0-9+/]{44,}([A-Za-z0-9+/]{4}|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==)",4
```


## Roadmap 🗺️

- [ ] Additional event type support 
- [ ] Integration with SIEM systems
- [ ] Pattern suggestion based on false positive feedback
