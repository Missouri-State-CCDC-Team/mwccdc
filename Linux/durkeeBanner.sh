************************************************************************************************************************
* Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Durkee the Wise?                                                              *
* I thought not. It’s not a story the Red Team would tell you.                                                         *
* It’s a Sith legend. Darth Durkee was a Dark Lord of the Sith,                                                        *
* so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the packets to create life…                              *
* He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the servers he cared about from getting Nyan Catted.*
* The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.                             *
* He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,                                         *
* which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,                     *
* then his apprentice killed his server in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others servers from death, but not his.    *
